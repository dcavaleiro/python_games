- **Game Features:**
  - A blank U.S. map appears.
  - The player is prompted to guess state names.
  - If the answer is correct:
    - The name appears on the correct location of the map.
    - The score increases.
  - Typing **Exit** ends the game early and creates a CSV file with the missing states.
